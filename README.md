# Score Keeper

Score Keeper started as part of the 'Making Websites Interactive' module in Scrimba's Front-end Developer Career Path. We were tasked with building a score keeping app and I made mine customized to some card games that my friends and I used to play. It is basic but works well enough as a customizable way to keep track of your score for games of all kinds.
